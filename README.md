# W-IDM_OmeroImporterPy
The OMERO Importer Python tool automatically reads bioimage data and metadata from a workstation, running the image acquisition software or an associated network drive and importing it to an available OMERO repository. Automated metadata annotation is carried out as follows:
1) Experimental and sample description Metadata is imported from customized metadata-collection Excel spreadsheets and written in OMERO as key/value or tag unstructured annotations.
2) Microscopy metadata is imported from Microscope-Hardware.JSON files produced using the Micro-Meta App (https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroMetaApp-Electron) and attached to the relevant image in OMERO. The content of these JSON files can then be visualized using the Micro-Meta App OMERO-plugin. (https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroMetaApp-Omero).
